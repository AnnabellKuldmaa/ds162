Game logic TODO's:
1) is_game_over: must return True if all ships on field belong to one player (is_game_over): function done
2) if one player is out of the game (all ships sunk) he can either observe or leave (all_ships_sunk)
3) if game over, owner can choose to restart game session-> NOT IN GAME
4) if player leaves all her ships must be removed (what does it mean?!?)
5) if only one player is online, game session should end (end_session)-> end_session
6) disconnecting and reconnecting


Overall TODO's:
1)messaging and notifications, e.g., sending updated boards, etc
* notify owner if someone joins
