Game logic TODO's:
1) is_game_over: must return True if all ships on field belong to one player, currently wrong
2) if one player is out of the game (all ships sunk) he can either observe or leave
3) if game over, owner can choose to restart game session
4) if player leaves all her ships must be removed (what does it mean?!?)
5) if only one player is online, game session should end
6) disconnecting and reconnecting


Overall TODO's:
1)messaging and notifications, e.g., sending updated boards, etc
* notify owner if someone joins
